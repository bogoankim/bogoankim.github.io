## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Data Science at Hanyang University](https://datascience.hanyang.ac.kr), advised by Prof. Kyung-Sik Han.  
I received my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Hanyang University, supported by the NRF Ph.D. Fellowship.

My research bridges Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Digital Health, and Inclusive AI.  
I’ve published 35 papers (11 SCI-indexed), received multiple fellowships and awards, and actively collaborate internationally.  
My current focus is on developing AI-assisted systems that support social independence and mental health for underserved populations.
